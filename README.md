==========

This is basically a link sharing web application that uses Rethinkdb as the database and technologies involved are : 

* React Js 
* Rethinkdb
* Node Js

### Approach
Essentially we are using the database for powering the entire application to maintain the instance of the links. The bigger picture for the application would be managing redundant instances of the same links to some sort of a cache mechanism.
